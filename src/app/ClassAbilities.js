                        point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

                        When a creature enters the spellâ€™s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
                        it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving
                        throw (DV {10 + player.stats.wis}). It takes 2d10 damage on a failed save, or half as
                        much damage on a successful one.

                        On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60

                        it until the spell ends. The targetâ€™s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell
                        ends if the target dons armor, if you dismiss the spell as an action or after eight hours.

                        sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that
                        creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 damage.
